### Instruction:
Create a 1 sentence long description of given tag.

### Input:
Wiki:
[[Vaginal]] or [[anal]] intercourse. Only use this tag for actual [[vaginal]] or [[anal]] penetration. Don't use it for [[oral|oral sex]], [[paizuri]], [[fingering]] or other acts that don't involve penile penetration or [[strap-on]]s.

When tagging images with this tag, be sure to also tag whether it's [[vaginal]] and / or [[anal]], too, if applicable.

If [[tentacles]] are involved, use [[tentacle sex]] instead.

If the sex involves 2 or more animals rather than humanoids, use [[mating (animal)|]] instead (not to be confused with [[bestiality]], where a humanoid has sex with an animal).

### Instruction:
Create a 1 sentence long description of given tag.

### Input:
A character or person depicted has [b]white colored hair[/b].

Due to the subjective nature of color judgment and other factors (such as the lighting on the characters) there is an overlap between this tag and several other hair colors in the very light color range.  This especially true in regards to the [[pink hair]], [[purple hair]], and [[grey hair]] tags. A good idea is to compare the hair color to any other white objects in the picture. If the hair is the same color, it should be tagged [[white hair]]. If it is darker or differently-colored, use the appropriate non-white tag.
